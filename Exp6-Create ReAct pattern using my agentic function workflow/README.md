## Exp6 - Create ReAct pattern using my agentic function workflow

### Objective
- Create a ReAct pattern using my agentic function workflow
- Goal is to return info about dog weights
- Can also do calculations
  
### Notes
- This system fails when the questions are not related to the functions that the model has access to.
- The system can't handle simple input like "Hello. How are you?"
